THE SIMPLE DOCBOOK XML TO POSTSCRIPT PROCESSOR
----------------------------------------------

I wrote SDoP because back in 2005 I was frustrated at the lack of free software
for processing DocBook that could produce really nice typographic output. Much
of the text formatting logic is taken from SGCAL, a previous typesetter whose
input was marked up text.


UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
-----------------

It should just be a matter of typing

  ./configure
  make
  make install

to get youself an installed sdop command. You can run the tests by "make check"
or "make test". Support for PNG and JPEG images is automatically included if
the relevent libraries are installed, but you can disable these optional
features by adding --disable-png or --disable-jpeg to the "configure" command.

There is a man page that lists the command arguments. The main documentation is
provided as a PDF file file in the doc directory. The xfpt source that was used
to create the XML that in turn was used to generate the PDF is also included,
along with the corresponding XML. You can get rid of sdop by "make uninstall".


OTHER SYSTEMS
-------------

SDoP consists almost entirely of Standard C code, and so it should be possible
to compile it on any system with a Standard C compiler and library. I think the
only non-standard function call is stat(), to check for a file's existence, and
that is in a module called sys.c.
