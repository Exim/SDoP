# The DocBook XML to PostScript processor

SDoP is a Simple DocBook Processor. It is a typesetting program that reads
DocBook XML and outputs the typeset pages as PostScript. This can easily be
converted into PDF form by the ps2pdf command that comes as part of the
GhostScript package. SDoP supports most of the subset of DocBook that is known
as "Simplified DocBook". Illustrations can be encapsulated PostScript, Scalable
Vector Graphics (basic support only) or, if the relevant libraries are
installed, JPEG or PNG images. You can read the 
[SDoP manual](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/sdop/blob/main/doc/sdop.pdf) 
on this GitHub site.
